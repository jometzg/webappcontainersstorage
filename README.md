# Web App for Containers persistent storage

This is a demonstration of how persistent storage may be used with Azure Web App for Containers. This demo uses Azure storage files attached to the web app to provide persistance for uploaded files.

This is an adaption of some sample code from here https://github.com/CodeMazeBlog/aspnetcore-mvc-series/tree/master/Part6/FileUpload

## What the application does
The application is a simple file upload one where you select a file and then upload its contents.
